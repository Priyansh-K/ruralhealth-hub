# Dashboard Analytics Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive dashboard analytics for the Rural Health Management System with both public and protected analytics routes as requested.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Public Dashboard Analytics
**Route**: `/dashboard` (No authentication required)
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Data Source**: System-wide analytics across all clinics
- **Features**:
  - Overall statistics (total clinics, patients, staff, visits, diagnoses, prescriptions)
  - Top 10 diagnosis codes with percentages and descriptions
  - Top prescriptions with usage patterns, dosages, and treatment durations
  - Patient demographics (age groups and gender distribution)
  - District analytics (performance by region)
  - Seasonal trends (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall illness patterns)
  - Monthly illness trends over the last 12 months

### 2. Protected Dashboard Analytics (Clinic-Specific)

#### Medical Portal Analytics
**Route**: `/portal/medical/analytics` (Requires doctor/nurse authentication)
- **File**: `src/app/portal/medical/analytics/page.tsx`
- **Access**: Medical staff only (doctors and nurses)
- **Features**: Clinic-specific analytics with tabbed interface
  - Overview: Key metrics and recent activity
  - Diagnoses: Top diagnosis codes for the clinic
  - Prescriptions: Most prescribed medications in the clinic
  - Trends: Demographics and seasonal patterns

#### Clinic Portal Analytics
**Route**: `/clinic/analytics` (Requires clinic staff authentication)
- **File**: `src/app/clinic/analytics/page.tsx`
- **Access**: Clinic administrative staff
- **Features**: Administrative view of clinic analytics
  - Overview: Operational metrics
  - Patients: Patient demographics
  - Operations: Administrative efficiency metrics
  - Diagnoses: Read-only view of medical diagnoses
  - Prescriptions: Read-only view of prescriptions
  - Trends: Seasonal and monthly operational trends

#### Staff Portal Analytics
**Route**: `/staff/analytics` (Requires clinic staff authentication)
- **File**: `src/app/staff/analytics/page.tsx`
- **Access**: Administrative staff
- **Features**: Staff-focused administrative analytics

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Type Definitions
**File**: `src/types/analytics.ts`
- `SystemAnalytics`: Interface for system-wide analytics
- `ClinicAnalytics`: Interface for clinic-specific analytics
- Supporting interfaces for demographics, trends, diagnoses, and prescriptions

### 2. API Integration
**File**: `src/lib/api.ts`
- `getSystemAnalytics()`: Public system-wide analytics
- `getDashboardContent()`: Alternative public endpoint
- `getClinicDashboardContent()`: Clinic-specific analytics
- `getStaffDashboardContent()`: Staff portal analytics
- `getMedicalDashboardContent()`: Medical portal analytics

### 3. Mock Data
**File**: `src/lib/mock-analytics.ts`
- Comprehensive mock data for testing
- Realistic healthcare analytics with proper medical codes
- Scaled appropriately for system vs. clinic views

### 4. UI Components
**File**: `src/components/ui/progress.tsx`
- Custom progress bar component for analytics visualizations

### 5. Navigation Integration
- **Main Navigation**: Added "Analytics" link in header for public access
- **Medical Sidebar**: Added "Analytics" menu item for medical staff
- **Clinic Sidebar**: Added "Analytics" menu item for clinic staff

}
```

### Clinic Analytics Response
Similar structure but filtered to show only data for the specific clinic.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Categorization of Diagnosis Types
- ICD-10 diagnosis codes with descriptions
- Count and percentage of each diagnosis
- Trend analysis over time

### 2. Prescription Analytics
- Medication names with usage frequency
- Average treatment duration in days
- Most common dosages for each medication
- Treatment pattern analysis

### 3. Demographic Segmentation
- **Age Groups**: Under 18, 18-30, 31-50, 51-70, Over 70
- **Gender Distribution**: Male/Female/Other with percentages

### 4. Temporal Analysis

### Next Steps for Production
1. Replace mock data with real API endpoints
2. Implement data caching for performance
3. Add real-time data updates
4. Implement data export functionality
5. Add more advanced analytics (charts, graphs)
6. Performance optimization for large datasets

## Usage Examples

### Get System-wide Analytics (Public)
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3002/dashboard"
```

### Get Clinic-specific Analytics (Protected)
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3002/portal/medical/analytics" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

This implementation provides comprehensive healthcare analytics that can support data-driven decision making for both individual clinics and system-wide health monitoring, exactly as requested in the original requirements.
