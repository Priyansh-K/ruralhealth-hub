# RBAC Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the new Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with dual login portals as specified in the updated workflow documentation.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Authentication System Updates
- **Auth Context** (`src/contexts/auth-context.tsx`):
  - Added `loginType` support with "staff" and "medical" options
  - Updated `clinicLogin` function to handle dual login types
  - Added routing logic based on userType and loginType
  - Enhanced authentication state management

### 2. New Medical Portal Structure
Created complete medical portal at `/portal/medical`:

- **Layout** (`src/app/portal/medical/layout.tsx`):
  - Role-based access control for doctors and nurses
  - Requires both appropriate userType and "medical" loginType
  - Integrated with MedicalSidebar component

- **Dashboard** (`src/app/portal/medical/page.tsx`):
  - Role-specific statistics and metrics
  - Recent activity displays
  - Conditional rendering for doctor vs nurse roles

- **Patients** (`src/app/portal/medical/patients/page.tsx`):
  - Read-only patient list with search functionality
  - Patient detail view integration
  - Medical staff perspective

- **Patient Details** (`src/app/portal/medical/patients/[id]/page.tsx`):
  - Comprehensive patient information
  - Visit history with medical records
  - Role-based action availability

- **Visits** (`src/app/portal/medical/visits/page.tsx`):
  - Visit creation and management
  - Patient selection and filtering
  - Medical record integration

- **Diagnoses** (`src/app/portal/medical/diagnoses/page.tsx`):
  - Doctor-only access restriction
  - Diagnosis creation and management
  - Comprehensive diagnosis tracking

- **Prescriptions** (`src/app/portal/medical/prescriptions/page.tsx`):
  - Doctor-only access restriction
  - Prescription creation with duration tracking
  - Medication management interface

### 3. Medical Sidebar Component
- **Component** (`src/components/layout/medical-sidebar.tsx`):
  - Role-based navigation filtering
  - Doctor vs Nurse menu restrictions
  - Consistent UI with other portals

### 4. API Client Updates
- **API Client** (`src/lib/api.ts`):
  - Added medical portal endpoints
  - Implemented all missing medical API methods
  - Proper endpoint separation (/portal/staff vs /portal/medical)

### 5. Clinic Portal Access Control
- **Layout** (`src/app/clinic/layout.tsx`):
  - Enhanced validation requiring both clinic_staff userType and "staff" loginType
  - Proper role separation enforcement

- **Visit Details** (`src/app/clinic/visits/[id]/page.tsx`):
  - **CRITICAL**: Removed all medical record creation functionality
  - Converted to read-only administrative view
  - Medical records displayed as informational only
  - Clear indicators that medical functions are managed by medical staff

### 6. Component Updates
- **Breadcrumb Navigation** (`src/components/layout/breadcrumb-nav.tsx`):
  - Extended support for "medical" userType
  - Proper navigation context for medical portal

### 7. Type System Updates
- **Types** (`src/types/index.ts`):
  - Enhanced Staff interface with proper role definitions
  - Fixed role type consistency throughout application

## Role Separation Implementation

### Clinic Staff Portal (`/clinic`)
- **Access**: Requires `userType: "clinic_staff"` AND `loginType: "staff"`
- **Functions**: Administrative tasks only
  - Patient registration and management
  - Staff management (adding doctors/nurses)
  - Visit scheduling and administrative notes
  - Financial and administrative reporting
  - **REMOVED**: Medical record creation (diagnoses, prescriptions)

### Medical Portal (`/portal/medical`)
- **Access**: Requires `userType: "doctor" | "nurse"` AND `loginType: "medical"`
- **Functions**: Medical practice activities
  - Medical record creation and management
  - Diagnosis creation and tracking
  - Prescription management (doctors only)
  - Patient medical history review
  - Visit documentation with medical details

## Access Control Matrix

| User Type | Login Type | Portal Access | Key Functions |
|-----------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| clinic_staff | staff | /clinic | Administrative tasks, no medical records |
| doctor | medical | /portal/medical | Full medical practice, all features |
| nurse | medical | /portal/medical | Medical practice, no prescriptions/diagnoses |
| patient | - | /patient | Patient portal access |
| admin | - | /admin | System administration |

## API Endpoint Separation

### Staff Portal APIs (`/portal/staff`)
- Patient registration and management
- Administrative reporting
- Staff management
- Scheduling and administrative tasks

### Medical Portal APIs (`/portal/medical`)
- Medical record management
- Diagnosis creation and tracking
- Prescription management
- Clinical documentation

## Validation and Testing

### Build Status
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All ESLint rules passing
- ✅ No runtime errors detected
- ✅ Proper type safety maintained

### Access Control Validation
- ✅ Clinic staff cannot access medical portal
- ✅ Medical staff cannot access clinic administrative portal
- ✅ Role-based navigation properly filtered
- ✅ Authentication routing works correctly

### Feature Separation Validation
- ✅ Medical record creation removed from clinic portal
- ✅ Administrative functions properly isolated
- ✅ Read-only medical record viewing in clinic portal
- ✅ Full medical functionality in medical portal

## Implementation Notes

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing patient and admin portals remain unchanged
2. **UI Consistency**: All new components follow existing design patterns
3. **Security**: Proper role validation at both route and component levels
4. **User Experience**: Clear portal separation with appropriate redirects
5. **Code Quality**: Maintained TypeScript strict mode and ESLint compliance

## Next Steps for Backend Integration

1. Ensure backend implements the dual login endpoint with `login_type` parameter
2. Verify API endpoints are separated between `/portal/staff` and `/portal/medical`
3. Test role-based JWT token validation
4. Validate proper CORS configuration for new endpoints

The implementation is complete and ready for integration with the updated backend API system.
